### Summary

Lee and Trevor had nice convincing wins this week. Trevor's team looks unstoppable! David and Nick H. had close battles but were able to squeak out the victory. Bill Joyner's team barely won but a win is a win I guess. Chris and Nick M. continue to look like shit. 
After two weeks, David and Trevor are the only undefeated teams. Chris and Nick M. are still the only winless teams.
