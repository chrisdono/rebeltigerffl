### Summary

Brian Nevill squeaked by a victory against Tyler Osteen in what was a hard fought battle. These two fantasy titans really showed their grit and determination in a closely matched game. Trevor Donovan took a beating from Nick Hassig in a matchup of fantasy all-stars. Hassig showed why he is a 2-time champion and put Donovan in his place. Meyer, Joyner, and Ostern all continue their losing ways.
