### Summary

Bill scored a season high 141 points to take down Butt Dial and his crew. That's what happens when you don't properly lube up your team before the game! Alan won again to keep his playoff chances high. Trevor and Lee also had big games to maintain their place in the standings. Tyler, Chris, and Nick M. all lost which dropped them down in the standings. David and Hassig continue to be the bottom feeders of the league.  *- Fake Commish*
