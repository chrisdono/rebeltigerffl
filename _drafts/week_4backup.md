### Summary

BILL got his ass kicked by David this week. BILL is really starting to look like a one-hit wonder. Trevor put up a good fight against Alan, but came up just short. Tyler had a big win against Nick H. to get back to .500 on the year. Lee and Brian both suffered tough losses.

Overall, it was a bad week for the ACC teams as they all went 1-3. Trevor and Alan are still looking good at 3-1, but the rest of the ACC teams are struggling. David is looking like the front runner right now.
