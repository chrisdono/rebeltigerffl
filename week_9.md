### Summary

Alan obliterated Brian this week in a matchup of two of the top teams in the league. Trevor eeked out a victory against Lee. Chris annihilated Tyler. David won a close one against Nick H. Bill and Nick M. played to a draw which is about as exciting as their teams are to watch.

Brian, Alan, Trevor, and Chris are all looking good for making the playoffs. David and Tyler are on the bubble. Hassig and Joyner are shit out of luck.  *- Fake Commish*
