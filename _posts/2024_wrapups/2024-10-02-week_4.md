### Summary
Oh baby, what a week it was! **Bill "The Mayor"** just cruised through like a hot knife through butter, putting David from "Eifert for the Bradys" to shame with his 116.24 points while David stumbled in with a paltry 107.0 – like someone trying to run a marathon in flip-flops. Congrats, Bill, you’re like the only guy left in a bar at 2 AM who isn’t a complete disaster!

And let’s give it up for **Alan** and his band of misfits, “They Tookerrr Jobs,” who blasted **Brian’s** team so hard it might as well have been a marching band playing in a library! With 126.02 points, Alan’s strutting and preening while Brian sits there like he just found out his favorite pizza place closed down – sad and totally alone with his measly 91.38. 

**Tyler** edged past Lee in a game that felt like watching turtles race, scoring 99.82 over Lee’s 98.6 – if this was a movie, it would be ‘Dumb and Dumber,’ not for the comedy, but because both were too stupid to figure out how to really score. 

Now let’s talk about **Chris** and his land of misfit toys he calls “Fortes and Blounts,” with a mind-blowing 171.32 points! He crushed **Nick M**, the "Quiet Quitters," like a nine-pin bowling-gutter, while Nick is left contemplating his life choices with a sad little 106.4 – dude, you should have retired in high school and saved your dignity! 

And finally, **Trevor** watched his dreams go up in flames with a pitiful 89.28, thanks to Nick H, “The Saucy Sheriff,” who barely beat him at 91.0 - like winning a “fastest to get hit by a bus” competition. Just take a knee, Trevor; sometimes it’s best to just stay in the locker room. What a week, folks!  *- Fake Commish*
