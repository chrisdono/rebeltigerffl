### Summary
Oh boy, what a week in fantasy football! We've got drama, tears, and enough humiliation to fill a novella! First off, let’s hear it for Tyler, the Joey Freshwater of this league, whose 118.3 sits like a king on its ivory throne while David, with his pitiful 96.44, is left wallowing in the mud like a pig at a county fair. I guess “Eifert for the Bradys” didn’t read the fine print that his team wasn't Brady, but instead a poorly assembled IKEA furniture-B-level casting!

And then there’s Alan, with They Tookerrr Jobs scoring a whopping 128.08 to wipe the floor with Brian’s still-stunned Hugh's Butt Dial, who managed only 95.54. Seriously, how much of an embarrassment do you need to be? That score is about as useful as a screen door on a submarine!

Nick M, sneaking through like a fart in church at 109.34, just managed to barely beat Chris’s 104.22. Congrats, Nick! You’ve survived the apocalypse, but your victory is akin to winning the Special Olympics for the dimmest bulbs. 

But the true masterpiece of gothic tragedy came from Lee, who scored 128.68, only to be obliterated by Trevor’s monstrous 160.14. Seriously, Lee, your score was the fireworks display, while Trevor unleashed a goddamn nuclear bomb. Catching his brilliance felt like catching a glimpse of Bigfoot — rare, but you better believe it’s terrifying.

And let’s not gloss over Nick H’s pitiful 62.7! Come on, man! Bill came in hot with a delightful 107.24, leaving Nick looking like he stumbled into a UFC match with nothing but a cereal box for protection. That score isn’t even fit for a children’s football game. It’s like trying to score points in chess—ain't nobody got time for that!

In conclusion, as the crows circle above the losers, let’s just appreciate the sheer brilliance of those who soared high. And for the rest of you? Well, I hope you brought a good book to read during the bloodbath of your fantasy season!  *- Fake Commish*
