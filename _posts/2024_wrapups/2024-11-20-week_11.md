### Summary
Oh boy, what a week it was in the fantasy football circus! Brian (Hugh's Butt Dial) strutted into the arena with a glorious 146.98 points, slapping David (Eifert for the Bradys) silly in a matchup that was supposed to be competitive but turned out to be a scene straight out of a toddler's temper tantrum. David, with a measly 123.58, might as well have sent in his grandma to help with the lineup—what a pathetic showing! You can almost hear the collective ‘sorry, bro’ from the fantasy realm.

In another showdown, Bill (The Mayor) flexed his dominance over Tyler (Joey Freshwater) like he was wrestling a sack of potatoes. With 120.4 points, Bill was cruising while Tyler, yeah, Tyler cratered with a dismal 99.48. I mean, come on, that's like showing up to the Super Bowl with a Pop Warner team—absolute shame!

Nick M (Quiet Quitters) played the game of "How Not to Win," dropping 122.94 while Alan (They Tookerrr Jobs) took home a solid victory with 133.94—thanks for showing us the art of losing gracefully, Nick! Meanwhile, Nick H (The Saucy Sheriff), you might want to rethink that badge because you just got whooped by Lee (Let 'em Breathe 68), who galloped in with a sweet 145.34 points. Nick, I guess you didn’t get the memo that we’re not here to play patty-cake!

And lastly, Chris (Fortes and Blounts) can officially join the loser’s lounge after managing a pathetic 98.16 against Trevor (Dixie Normous), who at least broke a hundred with 103.7. With scores lower than a Kardashian’s standards, it’s a wonder these teams even bothered to show up! Take a bow, winners, and lower the curtain on these sad sacks who clearly missed the mark.  *- Fake Commish*
