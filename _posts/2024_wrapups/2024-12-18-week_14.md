### Summary
**The Playoff Teams:**  

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round as we dive into the chaotic whirlpool that was Week 14 of our fantasy bloodbath! Props to Alan, who channeled all the avenging power of a thousand annoying motivational speeches and crushed Tyler like a final boss in a bad video game. You think you’re fresh, Tyler? Nah, you just got steamrolled by a guy who is clearly taking “They Tookerrr Jobs” way too seriously!

And let’s give a round of applause to Nick H, the Saucy Sheriff! He didn't just win; he threw a barbecue and invited everyone to witness the humiliation of Nick M, who’s now officially the poster boy for the Quiet Quitters. You ever seen a team fold faster than a cheap camping chair? That was Nick M this week, folks.

So that's it, the finals are set.  It will be Nick H vs Alan.  Let's Go!


**The Losers:** 

But wait, what’s that noise? It’s Chris, who showed up to the party with a bagpipe instead of a jersey – an embarrassing 172.28 is the kind of score that should come with a “we’re really sorry” card. Meanwhile, David waltzed in like he owned the place and made Chris the guest of honor at his own funeral. 

Lee! Oh Lee! You barely scraped past Brian, who looks like he’s lost a fight against a vending machine. I mean, 194.36? Really? That's not a score; it’s a cry for help! Come on, Brian! Get off the couch and show us your other personality that can score higher than breaking up with a text. 

And lastly, shout out to Trevor—Dixie Normous! He woke up and chose violence, sending Bill packing with a performance that had the grace of a gazelle on roller skates. Bill, my man, you came in looking like a kid who forgot his lunch and walked home to find his dog ate his homework. Week 14 is officially a bloodbath, and boy, does it feel good to watch the wreckage from above!  *- Fake Commish*
