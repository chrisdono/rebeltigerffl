### Summary
Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round as we dive into the riveting chaos of Week 8's matchups, where some soared like eagles, and others flopped harder than a pancake at a vegan brunch!

First up, we must throw a bouquet of gratitude to Tyler, aka Joey Freshwater, who dipped Trevor, the tragically named Dixie Normous, in a sea of shame with a glorious score of 129.88. Trevor's 109.32? That's about as impressive as a limp handshake from a guy who just saw his ex with someone better!

Then there's Chris, taking that sweet, sweet win over David, like a ravenous lion tearing apart a cold steak—163.42 points! David put up a pitiful 102—man, that’s like throwing a candy wrapper on the field and expecting a parade! 

Bill, “The Mayor,” put up a decent 119.26, but Alan's performance was so dominating at 144.74, it's like he walked into the stadium with a squad of superheroes while Bill was still figuring out how to put his shoes on the right feet! 

Brian, the lovely Captain of Hugh's Butt Dial, flaunted his score of 136.58, which is one hell of a middle finger to Lee's utterly forgettable 116.54. Watching this game was like tuning in to a rerun of a bad sitcom—no one cared, and my brain hurt more than watching a Kardashian try to spell “cat.”

Finally, we have the Nick show! Nick H, aka the Saucy Sheriff, fell like the last piece of bread in a lame sandwich with 113.82 points, while Nick M aka the Quiet Quitters sashayed away with a solid 127.38, looking like he just won the lottery while Nick H was stuck outside with the kid menu.

So here’s to the victors basking in their glory and a hearty laugh at the losers. Or should I say, the comedic relief in this debacle of a week—thanks for being the punching bags we needed to spice things up! You all put the “fun” in “dysfunctional.”  *- Fake Commish*
