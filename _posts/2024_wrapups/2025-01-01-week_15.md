### Summary
**The Finals:**  

Well, well, well! What a wild finish we had, where the cream truly rose to the top. First off, Nick H, the Saucy Sheriff, shot straight outta nowhere at the end of the season and put a whopping beatdown on Alan’s They Tookerrr Jobs. Congrats Nick on claiming this year's championship! 

**For Third Place:** 

Now, on to Nick M and his Quiet Quitters. The name’s perfect because they didn’t just win, they snuck up and blasted Tyler's Joey Freshwater right in the face! 287.28 points? What does that even mean? That’s a whole week’s worth of fantasy football dreams annihilated faster than a bad rom-com after the first act! Tyler should’ve just gone to his local bar instead of showing up for this slaughter. He scored 280.02, which, for anyone else, would be decent. But in this matchup? It’s like bringing a spoon to a knife fight.

**The Losers:**

Then we’ve got David’s Eifert for the Bradys, throwing a smackdown on Lee’s Let 'em Breathe — more like you should’ve let ‘em breathe so they could at least die with some dignity! Lee crawled to the finish with 150.32, a sad cry for help that even a toddler with a crayon could’ve beaten. David, on the other hand, strutted away with a solid 201.82. It’s like he walked onto their field in a tuxedo and said, “You’re underdressed for this occasion.”

And finally, Trevor’s Dixie Normous stomped on Chris’ Fortes and Blounts like it was a cockroach — a messy display of competitive superiority witnessed only when you realize Dwight Howard is somehow still in the league. Chris scored a paltry 170.9 while Trevor ascended like a phoenix from the ashes with 233.12. Chris, you might as well have just had your team do the Macarena on the field. What a trainwreck! 

Last but not least, we have Brian’s Hugh’s Butt Dial, who managed to win against Bill, who, let’s be honest, is about as relevant as a flip phone in a smartphone world. Brian cruised to a comfortable 221.02 as Bill wheezed under the pressure with a pathetic 193.18. Come on, Bill! What are you doing, playing fantasy football with a bag of ice strapped to your head? 

So, let us tip our hats to the true victors of the week, and shake our heads in disappointment at the rest. Remember, gang, in this crazy world of fantasy football: “You either win big or cry like a little baby watching The Notebook.”  *- Fake Commish*
