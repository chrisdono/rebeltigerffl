### Summary
Oh, what a glorious week it’s been in the realm of fantasy football! "They Tookerrr Jobs" came in like an over-caffeinated raccoon, scoring a stellar 136.9 to send Trevor's "Dixie Normous" packing with a feeble 105.24. Did Trevor forget to set his lineup, or was he just studying his last will and testament? Either way, that performance was as exciting as watching paint dry in a cemetery!

And poor Bill, "The Mayor," good lord. Scoring 81.9 is akin to trying to win a spaghetti-eating contest by only nibbling on the fork! David “Eifert for the Bradys" came in swinging with a triumphant 139.98, likely making Bill question every life decision that brought him to this moment. What a loser! 

Then we got Nick M, the "Quiet Quitters" who scored a respectable 123.76, while Brian "Hugh's Butt Dial" could only muster a pathetic 108.8. It’s like the guy just rolled out of bed to try and play football wearing flip-flops—no wonder he lost! 

In the not-so-glamorous showdown between Lee and Tyler, Tyler "Joey Freshwater" swam away with a commanding 135.66, leaving Lee gaping like a fish out of water with just 122.96 points to his name. Yikes, buddy, at least try to keep your head above water next time!

Finally, the “Saucy Sheriff” Nick H came to town and delivered a WHOPPING 144.82, absolutely wrecking Chris “Fortes and Blounts” 108.0 in a performance that was more one-sided than a toddler's drawing of a family. Seriously, Chris, did your whole team get stranded on a deserted island or what? The scoreboard wasn’t looking pretty, pal! 

So here’s to the victors, keep basking in the glory while the others lick their wounds like whipped dogs. It’s a grim league out there, and some of you might want to consider switching to bowling – might suit your skills just perfectly!  *- Fake Commish*
