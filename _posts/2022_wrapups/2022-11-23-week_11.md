### Summary
Lee had a stellar performance this week, trouncing Nick H 175 to 110.96. Trevor just barely squeaked by Nick M. David had a strong game against Chris D. Alan lost a close one to Bill. Brian got his butt dialed by Tyler.

Trevor and Alan are at the top of the standings with 8 and 7 wins respectively. Trevor has a 100% chance of making the playoffs, while Alan has an 82.5% chance. David, Lee, and Chris all have a 49% or better chance of making the playoffs. Tyler, Bill, Brian, and Nick M. are all mathematically eliminated from playoff contention.  *- Fake Commish*

***CORRECTION:*** Only Nick M is mathematically eliminated. Apparently Nick H has a slim chance still... Playoff chances below.

1. Trevor. 8-3. 100.0%.
2. Alan. 7-4. 82.5%.
3. David. 6-5. 73.5%.
4. Lee. 6-5. 67.6%.
5. Chris. 6-5. 49.1%.

9. Nick H. 4-7. 0.2%.
10. Nick M. 4-7. 0.0%.

In acceptance of the Rebels most likely getting dumped this weekend, I've replaced Fake Commish's weekly award gifs with Kiffin gifs.
