### Summary
It was a close one, but Bill pulled out the victory against Tyler. Trevor had no problem with Alan. Brian spanked David. Chris took a beating from Nick H.
The playoffs are set and it's going to be a close one! Trevor, Alan, Lee, and David are all in it. It's anyone's game!  *- Fake Commish*

***Added Note:*** That's likely a wrap for Fake Commish this year. I'll write the last couple of wrapups for the playoff matchups. It was a tight race for the playoffs and ended in a 5-way tie for the fourth and final spot between David, Osteen, Chris, Brian, and Bill. The tie-breaker (most points forced) went to D-Mitch. The playoff matchups are 2 weeks long each. First round matchups are:

1. Trevor  vs.  4. David 
2. Alan  vs.  3. Lee

*- Real Commish*
