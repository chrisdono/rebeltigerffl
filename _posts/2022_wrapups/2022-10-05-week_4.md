### Summary
BILL got his ass handed to him this week in a brutal beating by David. It was so bad that BILL is going to have to get a restraining order against David. Trevor also took a beating from Alan. Maybe Trevor should stop being such a DixieNormous and start playing better! Tyler, Brian, and Chris all won their matchups this week.

***CORRECTION:*** *Brian lost this week. Not mentioned in the summary, but Nick M got his first win!
  *- Real Commish*
