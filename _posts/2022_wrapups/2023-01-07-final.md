### How good were you?

The graph shows who had the strongest rosters and who made the best starter selections. The circles in the graph are teams that made the playoffs. It makes sense to see that 3 of the playoff teams were in the top right (strong roster and good starter selection). Lee didn't have the strongest overall roster, but he had good selections.  Only Bill has better selections, but that's likely due to his roster being hot garbage with limited tough decisions for selecting starters.
