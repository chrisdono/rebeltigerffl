### Summary
Week one is in the books and we had some great matchups. Nick M took an L in his debut against the Butt Dial. Tyler won the Joey Freshwater Bowl against Chris in a close one. Trevor won in a blowout against Bill. David Eiferted his way to victory against Nick H. In the closest matchup, Alan barely squeaked by with a win against Lee. 
It's still early, but Tyler, David, Brian, Alan, and Trevor all look like they could be contenders this year. Chris, Lee, Nick, Bill, and Nick have their work cut out for them if they want to make the playoffs.
