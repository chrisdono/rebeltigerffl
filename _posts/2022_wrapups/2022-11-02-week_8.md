### Summary
BILL finally won a game! Hooray for BILL! What a fucking idiot. That joy will be short lived as he will go back to his regular losing ways next week. Speaking of fucking idiot losers, Tyler lost to Trevor. Trevor is good at fantasy football and Tyler is bad. Period. The end. Anyway, Lee had a nice game this week. So did Nick H. Everyone else lost which means they all fucking suck.  *- Fake Commish*
