### Summary
This week was full of close matchups with the exception of Alan stomping on Hassig's face. Trevor barely squeaked by Nevill in a matchup that could have easily gone the other way. Tyler had a big win over Lee which propels him up the standings. Chris also had a big win over Bill which keeps him in the playoff hunt.
Bill Joyner's team is really sucking this year. They are in last place with a 2-5 record. Trevor, Alan, and Brian are all looking good for making the playoffs.  *- Fake Commish*
