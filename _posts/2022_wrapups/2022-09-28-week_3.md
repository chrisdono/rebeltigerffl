### Summary
In a close matchup, Hassig barely squeaked out a victory over Trevor. Trevor is really pissed off about that loss and will be looking to take out his frustration on the rest of the league. Brian Nevill won a close one against tyler. tyler is really shitty at fantasy football and needs to step up his game if he wants to compete with the big boys. David and Chris also won close matchups. Chris is looking like a strong contender this year and David is looking to make a run at the playoffs. Nick Meyer is really sucking dick this season and needs to step up his game.

***CORRECTION:*** *David lost to Chris. Chris looking like a strong contender is a bit of a stretch.*
  *- Real Commish*
