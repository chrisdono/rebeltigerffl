### Summary
Chris' team finally had a decent week when he threw up a lobotomy on Lee who is probably still trying to figure out what the fuck just happened. David took down Brian like Mike Tyson took down Butterbean. Trevor and Nick H had a fucking war that ended with Trevor winning on Matt Prater's last second field goal. Tyler's team is locking up the 1 seed, as they continue to dominate the league like a dude in prison dominating another dude in prison.  
The playoffs will be Tyler, Brian, David, and Lee vying for the title this year. Everyone else is eliminated from the playoffs and should be embarrassed about their performances this season - especially Alan who has lost 10 games!  *- Fake Commish*
