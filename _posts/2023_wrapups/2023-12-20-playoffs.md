### Semifinal Round Summary
1. Tyler (208)  vs.  4. Lee (177)
2. Brian (225)  vs.  3. David (233)

For the second year in a row David scored the most of any team for the two-week semifinal round upsetting Brian in the process to make it to the finals.

For the other matchup, Tyler squeaked by Lee with a not-so-stellar showing. There will be no repeat champion this year, Lee!

The final is set. Tyler vs David. Let's go!
