### Summary
Lee put his foot up David's ass and then there was some hopping around. Chris made Alan look like a slow Sunday driver trying to get through rush hour traffic. Nick H showed why he is the Saucy Sheriff with a top notch performance against Bill. Brian pulled off the biggest victory of the week beating Nick M who may as well just change their team name to the Quiet Quitters. 
Brian, Tyler, and Lee are all sitting atop the standings. These three must have plotted to take over the league, or at least that's what Alan thinks. Trevor, Bill, and Nick M are on the bubble for a playoff spot. Meanwhile, Chris is about as likely to make the playoffs as a snowball surviving an Arizona summer.  *- Fake Commish*
