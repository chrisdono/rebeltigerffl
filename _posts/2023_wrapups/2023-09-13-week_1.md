### Summary
Tyler kicked off the season with an impressive win over Nick H. that got the ball rolling for what should be an epic year. David, Bill, and Trevor all had nice wins in close games. Chris' team barely managed to pull out a win over Lee, who might have been out there with a piece of chalk using an abacus to count up his points. Brian and Alan took losses, but no shame in that.

Tyler is already flexing his muscles in first place and David, Bill, and Trevor aren't far behind him. Lee is bringing up the rear with a 0-1 start. Will Lee even make it through the year? Will Chris' team ever manage to get more than one win? There's only one way to find out!  *- Fake Commish*
