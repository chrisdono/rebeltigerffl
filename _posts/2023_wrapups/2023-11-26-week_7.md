### Summary
Trevor and Tyler both had strong performances this week. Trevor really drilled Brian in the butt with a massive 138 points. Chris continued to live up to his lame reputation by not even posting triple digits against Tyler. Lee squeaked out a win over Bill while David pulled off a close victory over Nick M.
Alan showed why he's the king of fantasy football by dominating Nick H who continues to have a good season despite his loss this week. 
Brian and Tyler are both in prime position for making the playoffs. While Alan sits at the bottom of the standings, everyone else is within striking distance of making the playoffs.  *- Fake Commish*
