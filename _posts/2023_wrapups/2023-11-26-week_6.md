### Summary
Trevor and Tyler both won close games this week. Trevor beat up David, while Tyler took it to Alan. It was a solid showing by Trevor and Tyler, though neither of them are even close to Brian. Brian annihilated Bill's team this week; that's gotta hurt Bill's pride more than his wallet hurts after he pays for an Uber. Lee took it to Nick H with 152.3 points so he obviously had a great line up this week. Chris' team got pummeled by Nick M this week; I mean we all knew Chris was gonna lose, but damn that was ugly!

The standings are looking real tight at the top with Brian, Lee, Tyler, David and Nick M all in contention for the top spots. Nick H., Bill, Trevor, and Chris sit just below them hoping to get a win or two and move up in the standings. Alan is out of contention for the playoffs but still has a few weeks to turn things around and prove why he should be taken seriously as a fantasy football owner.  *- Fake Commish*
