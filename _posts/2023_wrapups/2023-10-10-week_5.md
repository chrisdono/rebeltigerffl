### Summary
David is like a nuke and Cromartie is a tank! David blew Alan away with an insane 176.16. Bill's Mayor team was causing major damage this week with a big victory over Chris' Fortes and Blounts. Tyler, Lee, Nick M, and Nick H all had easy victories this week. Trevor and Brian were walking the plank after losses to Nick H and Lee. 
Tyler's team is leading the pack at 4-1 while Bill, Nick M, Nick H, and Lee are all sitting pretty at 3-2. Brian, Trevor, David, and Chris are teetering on the verge of irrelevance. Alan's team smells like shit they must've stepped in some because they got their asses handed to them this week!  *- Fake Commish*
