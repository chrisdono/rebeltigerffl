### Summary
David had himself a hell of a game this week, really letting Tyler have it. He should be ashamed of himself. Oh wait, he won, no need to be ashamed! Bill pulled off a huge upset over Trevor who clearly choked. Poor Trevor looked like Peyton Manning when he lost the super bowl. Nick M slayed the dragon Nick H and Chris couldn't hack it against Brian's butt dial defense.
Brian, Tyler, Lee, and David are all guaranteed a playoff spot. Alan is pretty much fucked for this year since he can't even crack 0% chance in the percentages. Chris' team looks like a 1990s expansion team, just really bad right now.  *- Fake Commish*
