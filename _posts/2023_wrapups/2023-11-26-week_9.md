### Summary
Lee got slapped down hard by Trevor this week, as if someone took their Oreos and shoved them into the toilet. Nick M didn't stand a chance against Bill, like trying to fight a Viking. Brian threw up a brick wall against Alan's offense, making it look like Alan was standing in front of The Great Wall of China. Nick H had a nice win this week but still not good enough to make the playoffs. Chris can't catch a break this season, truly the biggest schmuck in fantasy football.
Brian and Tyler are locked in for the playoffs with Lee just outside looking. With only one game separating three teams for two playoff spots it's gonna come down to the wire!  *- Fake Commish*
