### Summary
Chris finally got off the schneid and won a game this week against Trevor who took one in the nuts. Poor dude, they talk about his team like it's the 98 Astros. Lee really thrashed Tyler which is no surprise since Tyler has been dumping in his fantasy football playoff pants all year. David was able to get argumentative with Bill who was out of his league in this battle. Alan tried, but could not come up with the answers against Nick M, so he got sent home with his tail between his legs. Brian is still dominating with Hugh's Butt Dial and Nick H is still sucking even more cock than a drunken frat pledge on St Patty's day. Tyler, Lee, and Brian are all ensuring their spot in the playoffs while David, Nick M and Bill are fighting for the last two spots.  *- Fake Commish*
