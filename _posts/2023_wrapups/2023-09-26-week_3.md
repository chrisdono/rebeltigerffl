### Summary
Tyler dropped a huge payload on Brian's face this week. Brian Michael Scott should watch some commercials and sit out a few weeks. Trevor was taken behind the woodshed by Bill this week. What a brutal beating. Alan barely escaped with a victory over Chris, good thing Chris' team is as consistent as post-Seinfeld Jerry. Nick H got the shit kicked out of him by Nick M, but I guess it's probably his own damn fault. 
Bill, Trevor, Tyler, and Nick M lead the pack with 2 wins each. Brian is stuck in mediocrity at 1-2, while David, Alan, Lee and Nick H are at the bottom looking up. It looks like Chris is gearing up for a playoff run with 2 wins under his belt early in the season.  *- Fake Commish*
