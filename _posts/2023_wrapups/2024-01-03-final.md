### How good were you?

The graph shows who had the strongest rosters and who made the best starter selections. The circles in the graph are teams that made the playoffs. As expected, the four playoff teams were around the top right quadrant. "Try-hard Tyler" had a slightly below average roster but was efficient in his managing.  Brian had a solid roster with average management.  David had the best combination of personnel and management.
