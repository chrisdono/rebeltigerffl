### Summary
Lee got his ass handed to him by Brian who really put the moves on him. Can you say "How'd ya like that?" Tyler just barely squeaked by against Bill who must have been distracted or something. David plowed through Alan like a brontosaurus which demoralized the rest of Alan's team. Trevor beat Nick M but it was so close you might as well call it a tie. Nick H used his saucy sheriff powers to outscore Chris and take the W.  
Brian and Tyler have stamped their authority at the top with only 4 losses on their records. David had a good showing with 7 wins and 5 losses, basically securing his spot in the playoffs. Lee, Nick H, Trevor, and Nick M are battling for the last spot, but it looks like Lee has it in the bag! Bill, Chris, and Alan have been eliminated from playoff contention and their seasons have been flushed down the ol' doo-doo hole.   *- Fake Commish*
