### Summary
Tyler really got deep into Bill's ass this week. That was a thorough beating! Nick H showed David who the real Eifert for the Bradys are with a huge win. The tightest game of the week had to be Lee vs Alan. Looked like Lee found the fountain of youth as he scored over 100 this week. 
Tyler and Nick M. are leading the league with 3 wins each. Brian, Bill, Trevor, and Nick H are all hovering around .500. Unfortunately for David and Alan their playoff chances are as good as Tiger Woods in the long drive competition.  *- Fake Commish*
