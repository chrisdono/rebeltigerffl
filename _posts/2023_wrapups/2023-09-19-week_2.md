### Summary

Trevor put the clamps on Tyler this week and made Joey Freshwater look like a freshman learning how to drive a car.  Brian had a huge showing and made Alan feel like a toddler getting dropped off at his first day of school. David and Lee got their asses handed to them by Chris and Nick M., respectively. These four are about as likely to make the playoffs as a fish is likely to grow legs. 
Trevor and Chris lead the pack with impressive 2-0 records while Bill, Nick M., Nick H., Brian, Tyler, and David all stand at 1-1 looking for that playoff spot. Alan and Lee need miracle seasons if they want to have a shot at playoff contention.  *- Fake Commish*
